#  Metadata Portal ðŸŒ—

Metadata Portal is a self-hosted web page which shows you the latest metadata for a given network. 

This is an important addition to Signer, which can update the metadata inside only through a special video QR code without going online. 
Parity will host its own version of the page for all chains for which we sign the metadata. 
External users (chain owners) will be able to deploy their own versions of metadata portal if they want.

## Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
